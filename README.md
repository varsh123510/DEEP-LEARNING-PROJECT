*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK *
[16:43, 30/01/2025] Varsha: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn patterns and make predictions. It is widely used in various applications across industries. Here are some common deep learning tasks:

1️⃣ Image Processing & Computer Vision

✅ Image Classification

Task: Assigns a label to an image (e.g., detecting cats vs. dogs).

Example: MNIST digit classification, ResNet for ImageNet.

✅ Object Detection

Task: Identifies objects in an image with bounding boxes.

Example: YOLO, Faster R-CNN (used in surveillance, self-driving cars).

✅ Image Segmentation

Task: Classifies each pixel in an image (used in medical imaging).

Example: U-Net for medical image segmentation.

✅ Face Recognition

Task: Identifies faces in images or videos.

Example: FaceNet, DeepFace (used in security systems like Face ID).

2️⃣ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

✅ Text Classification

Task: Categorizes text (spam detection, sentiment analysis).

Example: BERT for sentiment analysis on Twitter data.

✅ Machine Translation

Task: Converts text from one language to another.

Example: Google Translate using Transformer models.

✅ Text Generation

Task: Generates human-like text.

Example: GPT models (ChatGPT, Bard, Llama).

✅ Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Task: Identifies names, places, and other entities in text.

Example: SpaCy, BERT-based NER models.

3️⃣ Speech and Audio Processing

✅ Speech Recognition

Task: Converts speech to text.

Example: Google Speech-to-Text, Siri, Alexa.

✅ Voice Synthesis (Text-to-Speech, TTS)

Task: Converts text into human-like speech.

Example: WaveNet, Tacotron 2.

✅ Music Generation

Task: Creates music using deep learning.

Example: MuseNet by OpenAI.

4️⃣ Reinforcement Learning (RL)

✅ Game Playing

Task: Teaches AI to play games through trial and error.

Example: AlphaGo, OpenAI’s Dota 2 bot.

✅ Robotics Control

Task: Optimizes movement in robotic systems.

Example: Boston Dynamics robots using RL.

5️⃣ Anomaly Detection & Forecasting

✅ Fraud Detection

Task: Identifies fraudulent transactions.

Example: Deep learning for credit card fraud detection.

✅ Stock Market Prediction

Task: Predicts future stock prices using deep learning.

Example: LSTM-based financial models.

✅ Medical Diagnosis

Task: Detects diseases from images (X-rays, MRIs).

Example: AI-powered cancer detection using CNNs.

Popular Deep Learning Frameworks

TensorFlow (Google)

PyTorch (Meta)

Keras (Simplified API for TensorFlow)

OpenCV (Computer Vision)

Hugging Face Transformers (NLP)

Conclusion

Deep learning is transforming healthcare, finance, security, robotics, and many other fields.
